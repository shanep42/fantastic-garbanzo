## Installation
    
You will need to install and initialize nodejs and inquirer, version 8.2.4. Then run using "node index.js" in the terminal.
    
## Usage
    
Simply answer the prompts (like I'm doing now - this project generated its own README) and your answers will automatically be inserted into formatted markdown in the readme.

Known issue: in Visual Studio Code, the preview tool will sometimes display an older version of the README.md in /Generated README folder. I believe this may be solved by not having the generator use the same location and filename every time, but it is definitely only an issue with how the preview is displayed, not with the actual output of the program.
